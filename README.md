# Settlers of Concat

## Synopsis
A zero player game to illustrate AWS Step Functions. Using [SFN](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) and [lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Services this is essentially a tutorial. It is based on popular tabletop game mechanics, but that is really just a point of familiarity to make it easier to digest. My work is in research programming, and this came out of a project where we used Step Functions to solve a data audit process requirement. In order to help promote the use of the processes outlined here, we needed a simple framework that could be used as a catalyst for learning methods of the Step Function.
